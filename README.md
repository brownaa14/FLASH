# FLASH Project
 Research building on Dr. Vinit Seghal and Dr. Binayak Mohanty's FLASH project for Near-Real-Time flash drought monitoring. Updated and deployed computation from 36km to 9km footprint for 16x resolution improvement. Increased model spatial coverage by roughly 20% during peak seasons
